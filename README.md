Please note: the Auto Preferences plugin has been merged into [Config Assistant 2.0](http://github.com/endevver/mt-plugin-config-assistant]. All users are recommended to upgrade to Config Assistant 2.0 or greater and remove Auto Preferences from their installation.

## Melody Users

Melody users have no need for this plugin as Config Assistant has been integrated into the core application (and this plugin along with it).
